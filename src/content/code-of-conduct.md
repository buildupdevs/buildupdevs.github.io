title: "Code of Conduct"
---

All participants of the BuildUpDevs (BUD) Community are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with BUD.

### Our Standards

#### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and making an effort to use gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best and the greater good for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting (a.k.a NSFW - not safe for work)
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests

#### We pledge to prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.

### Enforcement

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by contacting the team via Discord. In particular please send a DM to Clarkio and Dhanish until we implement more avenues for reporting violations. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

We believe in personal growth and providing opportunity to learn and improve oneself. In some cases, we will look for teachable moments to help individuals learn from their mistakes. With that in mind the leadership team's course of action to enforce the Code of Conduct will include the following:

- Receive and read through the report of a violation
- Investigate the violation and context
  - An example: The review team will look for a pattern in behavior such as prior violations either within the community or outside of it. If the behavior which results in violating this Code of Conduct is found outside of the community it will be count against the individual that is subject of the report.
- The subject of the violation report will be suspended/timed-out from the community while the team discusses and gathers a consensus on the severity and what repercussions to be applied
- Depending on the severity and repercussions the subject of the individual under review will be subject to one or more of the following: - A continued suspension/timeout - A permanent ban - A specified amount of time to reflect on their behavior to recognize the wrong they did, apologize and change behavior moving forward
- An individual only gets one warning. If a second violation is reported on the same individual, they will be permanently banned

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Please note this document is subject to change as we learn and grow ourselves as well. Any changes to this document will be shared and the community will be notified.

Feedback
If you have feedback on this Code of Conduct please reach out to Clarkio and Dhanish so that we may discuss it together and determine what course of action we can take as a result of it.
