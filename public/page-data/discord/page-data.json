In particular please send a DM to Clarkio and Dhanish until we implement more avenues for reporting violations. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.</p>\n<p>We believe in personal growth and providing opportunity to learn and improve oneself. In some cases, we will look for teachable moments to help individuals learn from their mistakes. With that in mind the leadership team's course of action to enforce the Code of Conduct will include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receive and read through the report of a violation</li>\n<li>Investigate the violation and context\n<ul>\n<li>An example: The review team will look for a pattern in behavior such as prior violations either within the community or outside of it. If the behavior which results in violating this Code of Conduct is found outside of the community it will be count against the individual that is subject of the report.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The subject of the violation report will be suspended/timed-out from the community while the team discusses and gathers a consensus on the severity and what repercussions to be applied</li>\n<li>Depending on the severity and repercussions the subject of the individual under review will be subject to one or more of the following: - A continued suspension/timeout - A permanent ban - A specified amount of time to reflect on their behavior to recognize the wrong they did, apologize and change behavior moving forward</li>\n<li>An individual only gets one warning. If a second violation is reported on the same individual, they will be permanently banned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>\n<p>Please note this document is subject to change as we learn and grow ourselves as well. Any changes to this document will be shared and the community will be notified.</p>\n<p>Feedback\nIf you have feedback on this Code of Conduct please reach out to Clarkio and Dhanish so that we may discuss it together and determine what course of action we can take as a result of it.</p>\n<p>Attribution\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.to/code-of-conduct\" target=\"_blank\">Dev.to</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4\" target=\"_blank\">Contributor Covenant, version 1.4</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.writespeakcode.com/code-of-conduct.html\" target=\"_blank\">Write/Speak/Code</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct\" target=\"_blank\">Geek Feminism</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3671731989"]}
